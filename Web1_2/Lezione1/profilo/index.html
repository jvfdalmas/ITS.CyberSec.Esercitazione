    <h2 style="color: rgb(66, 0, 127);" id="summary"><b>Summary</b></h2>
    <p>Qualified Brazilian corporate lawyer and technology enthusiast pursuing my second formation as a computer science specialist in Cybersecurity.
        
        With over a decade of experience as a corporate lawyer in Brazil, working with leading law firms and big corporations, I've specialized in contract negotiations, corporate governance, international transactions, investments and divestments, legal due diligence, compliance, and intellectual property. 
        
        Seeking new horizons, I took a break in my career and embarked on a sabbatical in 2022 to explore Italy. This journey led me to Rome, where I'm now engaged in a Cybersecurity specialist program (EQF level 5) and pursuing a Computer Science degree at Sapienza University.
        
        Presently, my focus lies on data privacy, General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR) compliance, digital forensics, Python development, cybersecurity defense, and security data analysis. 
        
        Native Brazilian and Italian citizen, I'm fluent in English, Italian, and have good commands in Spanish. I approach problem-solving with a mix of rationality and creativity, believing in persistence and strategic thinking as the keys to achieving my objectives. I hold honesty and transparency in high regard, both in personal and professional interactions, and I value mutual reciprocity.</p>
